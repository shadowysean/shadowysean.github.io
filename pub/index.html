This emerging network paradigm has attracted research attentions from both industry and academia. Topology control plays a crucial role in network design of IoT in order to enhance system performance and reduce system cost. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey of technical developments in applying topology control algorithms to the design of IoT. We first give a taxonomy of the available topology control algorithms; and then review some representative algorithms by following it. We intend to provide researchers and practitioners with a big picture reflecting the state of the art of this area and motivate more researchers to participate in IoT study, development and deployment.</em><br></span><br>Submitted to <strong><em>IEEE Network</em></strong>, under review</p>

The proposed protocol is composed of two critical phases: 1) adjusting the value of minimum-hops between a phantom node and its source, and varying the area of the phantom node distribution region at the network deployment stage; 2) generating a set of Gaussian-distributed random real numbers using the Pseudo Random Generator when the source node is transmitting data packets, and calculating the corresponding random walk hops. Theoretical analyses and simulation results show that PNDBPR can dramatically improve the diversity and the dynamicity of the phantom nodes distribution at the expense of a slight increase in communication overheads when compared with the existing PUSBRF (Source Location Privacy Preservation Protocol in Wireless Sensor Network Using Source Based Restricted Flooding) and HBDRW(A hop-based directed random walk) protocols.</em><br></span><br>In <strong><em>Proceedings of the 30th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC), May. 2015</em></strong></p>
<p>[RACS ‘15] <strong>On Selecting Composite Network-Cloud Services: A Quality-of-Service Based Approach</strong> <button id="btn_racs_15"><strong>Abstract</strong></button><br><u>Minkailu M. Jalloh, Shitong Zhu, and Jun Huang</u> <span hidden id="abs_racs_15"><br><br><em>Cloud computing, by definition, refers to the on-demand delivery of shared computing resources via the Internet. As the number of both potential cloud service and network service providers grows, selecting a set of these services with superior performance has been an issue. In this paper, we first formulate the process of selecting the optimal composition from all functionally-equivalent services as a multi-criterial decision making (MCDM) problem. We then employ the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), a method acquiring the objective weight of each criteria in terms of its information entropy, to optimally select the composition of network-Cloud services. Our evaluation results suggest proposed scheme can achieve a close-to-optimal solution to implement in practice with considerable flexibility and simplicity.</em><br></span><br>To appear in <strong><em>Proceedings of the 2015 Research in Adaptive and Convergent Systems (RACS), Oct. 2015</em></strong></p>

Most existing defense models only focus on the effects of P2P churn on reactive worm’s propagation, but neglect the impact of user behaviors on the spread of worms. This paper proposes a defense model of reactive worms based on dynamic time with full consideration of various dynamic factors that restrict the propagation of reactive worms in real networks; then compares major distinctions of several key parameters in worms’ propagation between models based on mean-field theory and the presented dynamic-time-based one; and deduces the crucial periods of time within a particular 24- hour day for defending against reactive worms’ attack.

<p>[JCP ‘14] <strong>Propagation of Active Worms in P2P Networks: Modeling and Analysis</strong> <button id="btn_jcp_14"><strong>Abstract</strong></button> <a href="../static/PDFs/JCP-14.pdf"><button><strong>PDF</strong></button></a><br><u>Haokun Tang, Yukui Lu, Shitong Zhu, and Jun Huang</u> <span hidden id="abs_jcp_14"><br><br><em>Active worms, a category of self-replicating malicious programs which could spread in an automated fashion and flood particular Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks within very short time, have drawn significant attention. However, only limited number of studies focus on propagation model of active worms with fair consideration of P2P nodes’ dynamic features consisting of P2P churn, random quarantine, regular immunization, dynamic fragmentation and etc. This paper proposes three propagation models of active worms under dynamic P2P environment, conducts a mathematical analysis on the propagation of active worms under presented models and provides extensive numerical studies to the impact of relevant parameters on active worms’ propagation speed under dynamic P2P environment. Models presented in this paper are simple, effective and thus applicable for defending against active worms in real P2P networks. </em><br></span><br>In <strong><em>Journal of Computers (JCP), Volume 9, Issue 11, Nov. 2014</em></strong></p>
